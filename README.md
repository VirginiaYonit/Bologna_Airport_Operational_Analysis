# Bologna Airport Operational Analysis
### Structured insights from 25 years of airport operations

This project explores the operational performance of Bologna Guglielmo Marconi Airport (ICAO: LIPE) through a structured, data-driven approach.

Combining publicly available datasets with domain knowledge from 25 years in aviation, the analysis highlights key post-pandemic trends related to traffic recovery, delay patterns, and environmental impact — especially CO₂ emissions.

## Project Scope

* Location: Bologna Airport (Italy)

* Period Covered: 2017–Q1 2025

* Themes Explored:

  * IFR traffic evolution

  * ATC pre-departure delays vs slot allocation

  * Passenger load factor and emissions efficiency

  * National vs local performance comparison

This work is designed with a practical purpose: to identify patterns that support operational planning, capacity management, and sustainable recovery strategies.

## Key Insights

* Traffic Recovery: Bologna’s IFR movements and passenger volumes now exceed pre-pandemic benchmarks.

* Delay Trends: ATC-related delays rose significantly in 2024–2025, especially in early summer, while slot delays remained low.

* CO₂ Efficiency: Load factor shows a strong correlation with emissions per passenger — underlining the link between efficiency and sustainability.

## Column Reference

Raw flight and delay data from Eurocontrol are fully documented in the notebook.
Note: Column FLT_DEP_1 was used as the reference for IFR departures due to its completeness and consistency across years.

## Tools Used

* Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly)

* Jupyter Notebook

* Excel (pre-cleaning & verification)

* Open data: Eurocontrol, Assaeroporti, Our World in Data
